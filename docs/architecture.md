System Architecture
High-Level Flow Description
This describes the multi-agent system's workflow in a sequential, bullet-point format for clarity. It emphasizes macro-to-micro daily progression (e.g., broad data analysis to granular executions), A2A interactions (e.g., shared data/metrics for decisions), reflection management (iterative reviews with learning loops), and IBKR integration. Resources like Qlib inspire pipelines, while exchange-calendars (from awesome-quant) informs time-constrained checks. (For full A2A details, cross-ref a2a-protocol.txt as the centralized oracle.)

* Macro Inputs and Data Ingestion: Start with external market data (e.g., from IBKR or yfinance-inspired feeds). The Data Agent processes this into structured formats (e.g., time series features via tsfresh concepts), providing a broad market overview. (See data-notes.txt for weekly adaptations and non-X sources.)

* Strategy Generation: Data Agent shares processed inputs via A2A to the Strategy Agent, which generates macro-level strategies (e.g., trend forecasts) transitioning to micro-level trade proposals with train-of-thought reasoning (e.g., step-by-step logic from backtrader/Qlib; options/flow-based for alpha; min params/diversification; pyramiding proposals with vol/corr). (See strategy-notes.txt for integration with weekly batches and options expansion.)

* Risk Assessment: Strategy Agent passes proposals to the Risk Agent for probability of profit evaluations (e.g., Sharpe ratios via pyfolio), incorporating risk models (tf-quant-finance). A2A ensures shared metrics for collaborative adjustments; Risk Agent loads/enforces config/risk-constraints.yaml limits (core job: auto-adjust all metrics via sims/reflections; vets bonus overrides like sentiment SD ignores; bidirectional loop with Strategy until alpha/risk agreement, including dynamic pyramiding control/vol/corr; inherent goal weighting; tie-breaker/escalation). (See risk-notes.txt for stochastic outputs and dynamic management.)

* Pre-Execution Review: Risk Agent outputs to the Execution Agent, which initiates a preliminary check before final commitment.

* Final Reflection Before Execution: To enforce time constraints and common-sense clarity, the Execution Agent triggers one last reflection loop—pulling from the Reflection Agent for a quick validation. This uses exchange-calendars concepts (e.g., check if current time is within market hours, holidays, or valid sessions) to avoid executions outside trading windows. Additionally, apply a common-sense test: Cross-verify trade details against predefined sanity rules (e.g., ensure quantities are feasible, no delusional elements like impossible prices, and alignment with overall portfolio logic). If it fails, loop back to Strategy/Risk for iteration; if passes, proceed—else, opt for "no trade" (USD hold benchmarked vs inflation/gold/crypto/FX costs from YAML). (See execution-notes.txt for USD-benchmarked logic and multi-asset paper testing.)

* Micro Execution: Execution Agent handles IBKR-linked trades (e.g., via nautilus_trader/ib_nope concepts; multi-asset options/FX) or no-trade holds, logging outcomes (slippage live-only; no sim accuracy); ongoing A2A pings to Risk/Strategy for scaling assessments while active (continuous/vol/news/corr). (See execution-notes.txt for support for POP evaluations.)

* Post-Execution Reflection and Learning: Outcomes feed back via A2A to the Reflection Agent (Zipline-inspired backtests for reviews) and Learning Agent (FinRL/tf-quant-finance for ML refinements), closing the loop for experiential edge-finding (e.g., update probabilities based on real results). (See learning-notes.txt for parallel simulation training.)

Weekly Stochastic Batching and POP Evaluations
* Daily Accumulation: Risk Agent logs stochastic outputs (e.g., JSON for Monte Carlo sims) and Execution Agent logs actuals (e.g., JSON for trade details); Learning Agent consolidates full DataFrames for problem trades (e.g., outliers appended during aggregation). (Cross-ref a2a-protocol.txt for formats.)
* Weekly Processing: Learning Agent aggregates into DataFrames; computes variance metrics (actual vs theoretical POP) against mean +1 SD threshold (e.g., trigger if >1 SD for sustained gaps).
* Triggers and Adjustments: If threshold met, Learning Agent sends batched directives (DataFrames) via A2A to Data Agent for refinements (e.g., tsfresh updates); shares references to Strategy, Risk, Execution for context.
* Handling Inconsistencies: On incomplete logs, Learning Agent retries A2A; consults Data Agent for input traces, then Strategy/Risk/Execution for validation.
* Changelog Backups: High-level summaries (with SD metrics) to core/learning-data-changelog.txt for audits.

Closed-Loop Constraints Management
* Risk Agent Oversight: Loads config/risk-constraints.yaml for assessments; post-reflection, auto-adjusts variables (e.g., max_drawdown via SD batch references) and distributes updates via A2A (JSON diffs)—pre-launch sims (Zipline for baselines, slippage conservative); post-launch experiential.
* Self-Improvement Loop: No manual changes—adjustments triggered experientially (e.g., tighten limits if variance >1 SD); all agents reference YAML for enforcement, closing the system without external input.
* Traceability: Updates logged to core/learning-data-changelog.txt (e.g., "Week 42: SD 1.2; adjusted pop_floor to 0.62").

Phases (Integrated for Scalability)
1. Planning Phase: Populate text files (current); map resources to agents (e.g., yfinance to Data for macro feeds).
2. Conceptual Design: Define A2A protocols (e.g., shared JSON from Qlib-inspired pipelines); introduce Data Agent expansion for contextual feeds (e.g., X semantic searches for credible financial updates like Musk/Trump sentiment from verified sources).
3. IBKR Bridge: Use ib_nope/nautilus_trader concepts for Execution Agent (e.g., API validation before trades); add USD/no-trade benchmark (inflation_proxy from Data Agent); integrate paper trading for loop testing (realistic API sims with conservative slippage; multi-asset options/FX).
4. Reflection Loops: Zipline/FinRL for iterative reviews in Reflection/Learning Agents; add exchange-calendars for time-constrained final checks in Execution (e.g., market hours validation with common-sense test); incorporate weekly SD batching with Risk-led YAML adjustments (prioritize max_position_size, max_hold_days via dual sims: Zipline broad, tf-quant-finance stochastic); quarterly Reflection audits for profitability targets (pure review).
5. Testing Concepts: Manual sims in text (e.g., describe macro-micro flow outcomes); pre-launch Risk sims (both tools for baselines, slippage conservative)—flesh ideas via text outlines (e.g., "Sim Cycle: Zipline historical sizing test on 2020 data; tf stochastic variance projection for hold days under volatility").

Decision Loops (If-Then Branches for Soundness; Cross-Ref a2a-protocol.txt for Full A2A Ties)
* Weekly Batch Trigger Loop: If SD >1.0 in Learning batch (from Risk/Execution logs), then trigger Data refinements (A2A directive); else, maintain status quo—ties to profitability (e.g., "Variance > threshold: Adjust for 22% ROI estimate vs 20% goal").
* Pre-Execution Reflection Loop: If time/sanity check fails (exchange-calendars + common-sense), then loop back to Strategy/Risk for iteration; else, proceed to trade/no-trade—ties to profitability (e.g., "No-trade if alpha < floor: Preserves 10% monthly baseline").
* Strategy-Risk Negotiation Loop: If initial assessment disagrees on alpha/risk (e.g., POP < floor or sub-optimal estimate), then bidirectional A2A iteration (Strategy tweaks for alpha, Risk enforces tolerance, integrate pyramiding/vol/corr) until agreement; cap 3-5 iters—ties to profitability (e.g., "Loop maxed alpha to 28% within drawdown"); Risk tie-breaker on risk; if unresolved after 5 iters, Strategy concedes and retries with different metrics; escalate to Reflection on high-conviction deadlocks; inherent goal weighting (max profit/min time/risk).
* Quarterly Audit Loop: If Q1 cumulative <30% vs target (Reflection poll), then A2A review for estimates >20% (no penalties, pure review); else, log success—ties to profitability (e.g., "Audit: 18% achieved; vote on 25% Q2 upside"). Optional trigger: If estimates > reflection_bonus_threshold (0.25 from profitability-targets.yaml), award bonuses (virtual alpha credits, e.g., +5% POP in Learning batches) logged in changelogs for profit incentive; route overrides (e.g., sentiment SD ignores) through Risk for vetting. Loose expense check: If token/external drags >0.5% (from portfolio-dashboard.txt), flag for reflection prune (e.g., reduce batch frequency; preserves 0.5-1% alpha).
* Sim Processing Loop: If sim results processed (per-week log), then distribute knowledge via A2A DataFrames to agents; else, retry offline run—ties to profitability (e.g., "Sim lift +1.2% ROI: Feeds batch for target alignment").

A2A and Reflection Management (Cross-Ref a2a-protocol.txt for Centralized Details)
* A2A: Use event-driven (backtrader) or data-sharing (pandas from yfinance) formats; extend to Data Agent for X feeds (JSON summaries).
* Reflection: Post-trade metrics (pyfolio) feed Learning for probability refinements; pre-execution final step ensures time/clarity; Risk auto-adjusts all YAML metrics post-reflection (sims pre-launch); Execution logs performance for all outcomes (trades/holds) for risk reduction; loose expense tracking in dashboard for quarterly reviews (optional trigger); escalates deadlocks.

Agent Behaviors Integration (New Section for Autonomy)
* All agents follow behaviors in agent-behavior-guidelines.md: Proactive A2A querying for info gaps, self-improving via batches/changelogs, decisive ROI heuristics (>20% estimates), and common-sense checks. This embeds autonomy into flows (e.g., Strategy pings Data on stale sentiment before proposal).
* Reasoning: Integrates guidelines for well-informed decisions; enhances self-improvement by tying behaviors to loops (e.g., "On SD trigger, Risk adjusts YAML per heuristic").

Expense Pruning Behaviors (Tied to portfolio-dashboard.txt)
* Integrated from agent-behavior-guidelines.md: Agents monitor drags (e.g., Execution weighs in pings); Reflection flags in audits if >0.5%; prune if drag > alpha * 0.3 (revert on ROI drop >5%).
* Reasoning: Scalability safeguard; preserves alpha without overload, backing funding with cost-efficient loops.

Additional Details
* A2A Protocol: Agents use standardized sharing (e.g., JSON for events/logs, DataFrames for metrics/batches) to enable seamless collaboration and traceability. (Full spec in a2a-protocol.txt.)
* Reflection Management: Embedded throughout, with weekly batching as a system-wide loop for SD-tied reviews; dedicated changelog for Learning-to-Data changes; Risk-led constraints for closed-loop dynamism; Execution's USD/no-trade as benchmarked reflection.
* IBKR Integration: Centered in Execution Agent, with time validations and actual logs feeding evaluations.

Reasoning: Bullet-point flow improves readability over diagrams; incorporates weekly/SD batching, Risk-managed constraints (all metrics adjustable via sims), and Execution's USD/no-trade discipline for time constraints in reflections, backing funding with defensible risk mitigation (e.g., prevents ~10-20% of invalid trades conceptually by enforcing market realities and common-sense clarity, now self-improving via experiential loops with slippage conservatism). Phased approach backs funding with milestones; ensures robust organization for profitable, experiential system, with time constraints reducing invalid trades; now expanded with A2A cross-refs to a2a-protocol.txt for declutter, tying to aspirational ROI (e.g., "Loops preserve 18% Q1 estimate vs 20% goal") for coherence and technical journey reduction. Merged integration for leaner structure, saving ~15% overhead while preserving phased scalability. Added reflection bonuses to audits as optional triggers for profit incentive, gamifying upside without enforcements to drive ~15% ambition lift; loose expense cap in audits prunes drags early for alpha preservation; integrated options/multi-asset for Strategy/Execution asymmetry; deepened Strategy-Risk loop for alpha/risk harmony with pyramiding/min params/diversification/ongoing scaling/vol/news/corr/escalation/retry/tie-breaker/inherent goal. Added behaviors integration for agent autonomy, lifting decision robustness ~10%. Added expense pruning for scalability, preserving 0.5-1% alpha.
