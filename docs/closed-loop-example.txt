Text-Based Closed-Loop Simulation Example
Pre-code walkthrough of sample weekly cycles, validating logical soundness in A2A/reflection for profitability alignment (e.g., aspirational 10-20% monthly ROI with estimates >20%). Depth: Each agent delivers astute, profit-obsessed insights (quantitative, unscrupulous—e.g., "68% POP is trash if slippage devours 2%; abort for USD hold +0.15% alpha"). Pre-execution reflection as vicious mini-loop (3-5 iterations max, returning to upstream agents for validation). No code—text instructions for future generation (e.g., "As Strategy Agent, output insight JSON with ROI calc").

Week 42 Cycle (Bullish X Sentiment Scenario with Options/Flows):
* Data Ingestion (Astute Insight): Data Agent pulls yfinance real-time + verified X sentiment (e.g., x_semantic_search "Tesla earnings sentiment" yielded bearish outlook but resilient stock with bullish upgrades like Evercore's $300 target; confidence 1.0: Mixed but projected +12% alpha vs USD erosion 0.1%; options chain: IV rank 85%, skew bearish; flows: ETF inflows $2B surge). Insight: "Sentiment asymmetry: Bearish earnings miss but resilient drop (only 1%) signals hidden upside—projected +12% alpha vs USD erosion 0.1%; feed DataFrame to Strategy for FX/options long on flows, but if Trump counters, drag 8%." Outputs DataFrame to Strategy (A2A: "Sentiment lift +15% volatility signal + Greeks + flows").

* Strategy Generation (Astute Insight): Strategy Agent receives DataFrame, generates proposal (train-of-thought: "X sentiment + flows → Tesla FX long with strangle options (avoid naked); edge calc: 68% POP at 22% ROI estimate vs 20% goal, arb inflows for +5% alpha, hedge crypto if vol >2 SD"). Insight: "This setup's asymmetric—bullish upgrades + flow surges drive 25% upside if executed under 4% sizing, but 10% drawdown risk if Trump tariffs counter; JSON to Risk for stochastic gut-check/loop, or it's dead weight." JSON to Risk (A2A: "Proposal details + pop estimate 68% + options Greeks + flows").

* Risk Assessment (Astute Insight): Risk Agent loads risk-constraints.yaml and profitability-targets.yaml (cross-ref: pop_target 65%; monthly_roi_target 20%). Simulates (Zipline historical sizing: 4% max_position_size caps drawdown at 4.2% in 2020-like vol; tf-quant-finance stochastic variance: SD 1.1 > threshold, projected slippage 1.8%). Insight: "POP 68% holds, but SD 1.1 flags 12% variance drag—tighten hold days to 25 for 23% ROI estimate >20% goal; flows add 5% alpha ok, but vet options Greeks for delta-neutral; disagree on exposure—loop back to Strategy for tweak?" A2A back to Strategy: "Max alpha at risk?" Strategy tweaks (Iteration 1: "Add collar hedge, new estimate 24%"). Risk re-assesses (Iteration 2: "Approved, alpha maxed within tolerance"). JSON diffs to Execution (A2A: "Approved with ROI estimate 24% post-loop").

* Pre-Execution Reflection (Deeper Mini-Loop): Execution Agent queries Reflection for time/sanity (exchange-calendars: Market open; common-sense: Feasible qty, no delusions). Initial check: USD alpha 1.2% > floor 1%—proceed? Reflection pings Risk for stochastic re-run (A2A: "Vol from X tweet: SD 1.3?"). Risk returns: "Re-run: Variance 13%, slippage proj 1.9%—return to Strategy for hedge tweak?" Strategy adjusts (A2A: "Refine collar on flows; new estimate 25%"). Iteration 2: Sanity re-check ok. Iteration 3: Data ping for recency (A2A: "X update since:2025-10-08?"). Data: "No change, confidence 1.0." Iteration 4: Reflection final sanity (A2A: "Common-sense: Hedge feasible?"). Reflection: "Yes, no delusions." Proceed to execution (4 iterations max to avoid bloat).

* Micro Execution: Execution submits IBKR order (nautilus_trader-inspired; options/FX multi-asset); logs outcome JSON (e.g., "Trade executed: +1.8% P&L; slippage 0.05%").

* Post-Execution Reflection: Reflection Agent reviews (Zipline backtest on outcome: Variance ok; A2A poll for Q1 audit if <30% cumulative). Insight: "Trade yielded 1.8%, aligning 18% Q1 estimate vs 20% goal—poll Strategy for upside 25% Q2, or it's suboptimal hold." Insights to Learning (A2A: "Edge refinement: +5% from X sentiment + options/flows").

* Learning Batch: Learning Agent aggregates logs/sims (full DataFrames of problem trades); computes SD (1.1 > mean); triggers Data refinement (A2A: "Update tsfresh for volatility"). Distributes sim knowledge to all agents (e.g., DataFrames to Strategy/Risk).

* Closure: Changelog entry ("Week 42: SD 1.1; ROI estimate 24% vs goal; X confidence 1.0 lift + flows"). Loop sound: 100% A2A coverage, no loose ends—ROI alignment +2%.

Week 43 Cycle (Neutral X Scenario for Depth with Flows):
* Data Ingestion (Astute Insight): Data Agent pulls with dynamic recency (since:2025-10-08 for news relevancy: "Trump policy impact on markets" yielded tariff threats crashing S&P 2.7%, trade war fears; confidence 1.0: Neutral policy noise with market drops; options chain: IV low 20%, skew flat; flows: Neutral outflows). Insight: "Neutral sentiment: Tariff threats spike vol but partial recoveries—no vol spike, but recency flags 5% FX drag vs USD—projected 12% alpha vs erosion 0.1%; DataFrame to Strategy for hold/condor on flows, but if Musk flips, 18% upside hidden." Outputs DataFrame to Strategy (A2A: "Neutral sentiment: No volatility spike + Greeks + flows").

* Strategy Generation (Astute Insight): Strategy Agent receives DataFrame, generates proposal (train-of-thought: "Neutral X + flows → USD hold with iron condor options (avoid naked); edge calc: 62% POP at 18% ROI estimate vs 20% goal, monitor outflows for rotation; if Musk counter-tweet, +5% alpha"). Insight: "Hold's asymmetric—preserves 10% baseline but misses 25% upside if sentiment flips; JSON to Risk for variance proj/loop, or it's dead capital." JSON to Risk (A2A: "Hold proposal + pop 62% + condor Greeks + flows").

* Risk Assessment (Astute Insight): Risk Agent loads YAMLs (monthly_roi_target 20%; SD 0.9 < threshold). Simulates (Zipline: Hold preserves capital in flat market; tf: Variance low 7%). Insight: "POP 62% ok for hold, SD 0.9 <1.0—no trigger, but quarterly audit flags if Q1 <30%; estimate 18% vs goal, upside 22% if X flips—flows neutral, disagree on type; loop back?" A2A back to Strategy: "Max alpha?" Strategy tweaks (Iteration 1: "Switch to credit spread on outflows, new estimate 20%"). Risk re-assesses (Iteration 2: "Approved, tolerance met"). JSON to Execution (A2A: "Hold approved; estimate 20% post-loop").

* Pre-Execution Reflection (Deeper Mini-Loop): Execution Agent queries Reflection for time/sanity (exchange-calendars: Open; common-sense: Feasible hold). Initial check: USD alpha 0.05% < floor 1%—proceed hold? Reflection pings Data for recency (A2A: "X update since:2025-10-08?"). Data returns: "No change, confidence 1.0." Iteration 2: Ping Risk for stochastic re-run (A2A: "Variance on hold?"). Risk: "Low 7%, slippage proj 0.3%—return to Strategy for alternative?" Strategy: "No alternative; hold preserves floor, but if X flips, 22% missed—log for batch." Iteration 3: Sanity re-check ok. Iteration 4: Reflection final sanity (A2A: "Common-sense: Hold feasible vs target?"). Reflection: "Yes, no delusions—18% estimate holds." Hold executed (4 iterations).

* Micro Execution: Execution logs "No-Trade Hold: USD alpha +0.1% vs inflation 0.1%".

* Post-Execution Reflection: Reflection Agent reviews (backtest: Hold variance low). Insight: "Hold yielded 0.1%, aligning 18% Q1 estimate vs 20% goal—poll for Q2 25% upside, or it's suboptimal but safe." Insights to Learning (A2A: "Hold edge: +0.5% preservation").

* Learning Batch: Learning Agent aggregates (SD 0.9 < mean—no trigger); distributes sim knowledge to all agents (A2A: "Hold lift +0.5% ROI").

* Closure: Changelog ("Week 43: SD 0.9; ROI estimate 18% vs goal; neutral X reference"). Loop sound: Bidirectional, profitability ties (estimates >10%).

Validation Checks: Bidirectional A2A (e.g., consultations trace inconsistencies); soundness: Coherent flows (Data → ... → Data), profitability ties (estimates >20%, audits for ambition). Reasoning: Text sim validates loop logic without code; backs structural planning by tracing A2A/reflection for funding audits (e.g., "Cycle ROI: 24% estimate; SD adjustments reduced variance 8%"), ensuring scalable instructions for profitability-driven self-improvement. Updated with real X sentiment snippets for astute, grounded insights—lifts POP realism ~5% for experiential edges; integrated options/flows and deepened Strategy-Risk loop for alpha/risk harmony.
