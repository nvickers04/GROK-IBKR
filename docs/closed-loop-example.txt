Week 44 Cycle (Bearish Scenario with Override Vetting, Testing Behaviors):
* Data Ingestion (Astute Insight, Per Behaviors): Data Agent validates sources (yfinance/IBKR match 98%; consults changelog for prior SD 1.1 on vol). Pulls X sentiment (x_semantic_search "Trump tariff impact from:verified since:2025-10-15" yielded bearish FX drop 3%, confidence 0.85 >0.6; dark pool surges hint institutional sell-off). Insight: "Bearish asymmetry: Tariffs spike vol but dark pools show 5% front-run edge—projected 15% alpha vs USD 0.1% erosion if vetted; DataFrame to Strategy, flag for SD ignore if confidence high." Outputs DataFrame (A2A: "Bearish sentiment + Greeks + flows").
* Strategy Generation (Astute Insight, Per Behaviors): Strategy receives, estimates >20% ROI (train-of-thought: "Bearish X + flows → Propose protective put options with pyramid on losers; edge: 65% POP at 25% ROI vs goal, unscrupulous arb dark pools for +10% if SD ignored"). Insight: "Push 30%+ play on flows >$1B, but consult Risk for vet; if low conviction, diversify to FX hedge." JSON to Risk (A2A: "Proposal + estimate 25% + options").
* Risk Assessment (Astute Insight, Per Behaviors): Risk loads YAMLs, re-runs stochastics (SD 1.2 >1.0, but X confidence 0.85: Vet override with caps—sizing <3%, POP 72% post). Insight: "SD flag but override approved (re-run sims: Variance 10%); alpha maxed at 26% >20%; disagree on pyramid—loop back?" A2A to Strategy: "Suggest cap for +5% buffer." Strategy tweaks (Iteration 1: "Adjust tiers, new 27%"). Risk approves (Iteration 2: "Agreement, tie-breaker not needed"). JSON to Execution (A2A: "Approved 27% post-vet").
* Pre-Execution Reflection (Deeper Mini-Loop, Per Behaviors): Execution queries Reflection (market open; common-sense: Feasible Greeks? Ping Data—no delusions). Initial: Alpha 1.5% > floor. Reflection pings Risk (A2A: "SD override sanity?"). Risk: "Vetted ok." Iteration 2: Strategy for tweak if needed. Iteration 3: Data for recency (no change). Iteration 4: Proceed (4 iters).
* Micro Execution: Executes options/FX; logs "+1.5% P&L, drag 0.2% weighed".
* Post-Execution Reflection: Reflection reviews (poll for bonus: Estimates >25%—award +5% POP credit); Insight: "Trade 1.5%, Q1 20% vs goal—vote upside 28% Q2." To Learning (A2A: "Override edge +10%").
* Learning Batch: Aggregates (SD 1.2 > mean—trigger directive); distributes (A2A: "Prune low-POP; lift +1.5%").
* Closure: Changelog ("Week 44: SD 1.2; ROI 27% vs goal; override vetted"). Loop sound: Behaviors ensured informed vetting, +3% alpha.
Validation Checks: Behaviors integrated (e.g., proactive queries, ROI heuristics); soundness: Profit ties (>20% estimates).
Reasoning: Added cycle tests override behaviors; validates unscrupulous edges with discipline.

Week 45 Cycle (Low-Vol Scenario with Pruning/Polling, Testing Behaviors):
* Data Ingestion (Astute Insight, Per Behaviors): Data validates (changelog prior SD 0.9; X search "Musk low-vol trends" confidence 0.7). Insight: "Low-vol: Neutral flows, project 18% alpha; DataFrame to Strategy." A2A: "Neutral + Greeks".
* Strategy Generation (Astute Insight, Per Behaviors): Estimates 22% ROI (tot: "Low-vol → Iron condor; prune low-POP prior setups"). Insight: "Diversify for 25% upside." JSON to Risk.
* Risk Assessment (Astute Insight, Per Behaviors): Re-runs (SD 0.8 <1.0; regime bear weight: risk 0.40). Insight: "Approved 23%; no override." A2A to Execution.
* Pre-Execution Reflection (Mini-Loop): Sanity ok (3 iters).
* Micro Execution: Executes; logs "+1.2%, drag 0.3%".
* Post-Execution Reflection: Polls for bonus (estimates >25%? No; prune drag if >0.3%). Insight: "Poll: +5% credit denied." To Learning.
* Learning Batch: Aggregates (SD 0.8—no trigger; prune <threshold). Distributes.
* Closure: Changelog ("Week 45: SD 0.8; ROI 23%; pruning applied"). Sound: Behaviors tested pruning/polling.
Reasoning: Cycle validates expense/pruning behaviors; +2% alpha preservation.
