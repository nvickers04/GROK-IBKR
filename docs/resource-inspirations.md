# Resource Inspirations from Awesome-Quant

This file documents conceptual inspirations from selected awesome-quant resources, adapted for the multi-agent system. Focus on high-level ideas (e.g., workflows, metrics) to inform agents, A2A, reflection, and IBKR—ensuring originality and scalability.

## Top Resources and Inspirations
- **Qlib**: End-to-end ML pipeline (data → model → backtest → risk); inspire A2A chaining and reflection loops for edge refinement.
- **FinRL-Library**: RL environments for simulated experiences; adapt for learning agent iterations on trade outcomes.
- **backtrader**: Event-driven strategy execution; conceptual for A2A event messaging and backtesting metrics.
- **Zipline**: Data bundles and simulation engines; inspire shared data formats in A2A and historical reflection.
- **pyfolio**: Performance tear sheets (e.g., Sharpe ratio); use for risk agent metrics in probability assignments.
- **nautilus_trader**: Modular trading platform; adapt for execution agent's IBKR handling and high-perf A2A.
- **tf-quant-finance**: Stochastic ML models; inspire learning agent's calibration for probabilities.
- **ib_nope**: IBKR automation logic; conceptual for direct API bridges in execution.
- **yfinance**: Real-time data querying; adapt for data agent's ingestion workflows.
- **tsfresh**: Automated time series features; inspire feature engineering in learning for macro-micro signals.
- **exchange-calendars**: Trading schedule handling (market hours, holidays); inspire final pre-execution reflection in Execution Agent for time constraints and common-sense validations (e.g., avoid off-hours trades).

Reasoning: These inspirations keep the system modular, with backups for funding (e.g., exchange-calendars enhances profitability by enforcing time realities in reflections, preventing invalid executions).
