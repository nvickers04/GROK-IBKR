# Resources Overview

Merged mappings, inspirations, and matrix for agent fits, A2A/reflection, IBKR notes, and project pillars.

| Resource | Rank | Primary/Secondary Agents | A2A/Reflection Fit | IBKR Notes | Project Pillar Alignment | Reasoning |
|----------|------|---------------------------|---------------------|------------|---------------------------|-----------|
| Qlib | 1 | Learning, Strategy | Shared datasets for batching (DataFrames); reflection loops via ML pipelines | Complements API pulls | ML edges, stochastic batching | High-quality for A2A chaining; backs weekly SD refinements for POP variances. |
| FinRL-Library | 2 | Learning, Reflection | RL for experiential POP evals; weekly batch references | N/A | Adaptive profitability | Enables SD-thresholded iterations; traceable for funded evolutions. |
| backtrader | 3 | Strategy, Execution | Event-driven JSON logs for A2A; reflection on executions | Live modes for IBKR | Macro-micro flows | Supports batch sharing; reduces randomness in proposals. |
| tf-quant-finance | 4 | Risk, Learning | Stochastic models for weekly batches/SD thresholds | Portfolio calcs | Probability assessments | Quantifiable variances; backs audits on real-vs-theoretical gaps. |
| pyfolio | 5 | Risk, Reflection | Metrics for POP comparisons; batch summaries | Real-trade analytics | Risk management | High adaptability for reflections; ties to profitability backups. |
| Zipline | 6 | Reflection, Strategy | Backtests for variance reviews; weekly references | Historical validation | Experiential learning | Core for loops; ensures SD-triggered stability. |
| nautilus_trader | 7 | Execution, Strategy | Broker integration for logs; A2A retries | Direct IBKR support | Micro executions | Enhances robustness; traceable for compliance. |
| tsfresh | 8 | Data, Risk | Feature extraction for batch refinements | N/A | Data ingestion | Automates weekly adaptations; broad view backups. |
| yfinance | 9 | Data | Real-time queries for inputs; consultation traces | External IBKR complement | Macro inputs | Foundation for stability; reduces input inconsistencies. |
| exchange-calendars | 10 | Execution, Reflection | Time validations in batches | Market hours checks | Reflection ties | Mitigates invalid trades; ~10-20% risk reduction conceptually.

Inspirations: High-level concepts from awesome-quant (e.g., Qlib for end-to-end ML in weekly batching; tf-quant-finance for SD-tied stochastic sims).

Weekly Batching Ties: Resources like tf-quant-finance support aggregation for Learning Agent; changelog summaries in core/learning-data-changelog.txt ensure high-level readability.

Reasoning: Streamlines audits with merged matrix; quantifiable backups (e.g., ranks for A2A fits) support funding on experiential edge-finding, now enhanced by weekly/SD batching for variance mitigation and profitability.
