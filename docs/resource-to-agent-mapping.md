# Resource-to-Agent Mapping

This mapping assigns top resources to agents, detailing how concepts support A2A, reflection, IBKR, and project pillars (macro-micro flows, train-of-thought, probability, trading, learning).

| Resource (Rank) | Primary Agent(s) | Secondary Agent(s) | Mapping Details & A2A/Reflection Fit | IBKR Integration Notes | Reasoning (Backup for Funding) |

A2A: Shares metric DataFrames; Reflection: Draws insights for edge refinements. | Yes: Complements IBKR portfolio data. | Risk-centric for daily assessments; organizes A2A with quantifiable backups, supporting funding claims on robust probability-driven decisions. |
| nautilus_trader (6) | Execution Agent, Strategy Agent | Data Agent | High-perf platform: Execution Agent for micro trades (IBKR execution), Strategy Agent for event-driven macro strategies. A2A: Tick-level events for real-time comms; Reflection: Built-in backtester for reviews. | Yes: Direct broker support, including IBKR. | Performance for scalable A2A; maps to micro execution while backing macro flows, with traceable integration for funded reliability. |
| tf-quant-finance (7) | Learning Agent | Risk Agent, Strategy Agent | TensorFlow ML models: Learning Agent for stochastic edge-finding (experiential calibration), Risk Agent for probability models. A2A: Graph outputs shared; Reflection: Model evals for iterations. | Partial: Pricing sims for IBKR instruments. | ML depth for your learning focus; enables A2A with advanced trains-of-thought, providing structural backups for AI profitability. |
| ib_nope (8) | Execution Agent | Data Agent | IBKR-specific automation: Execution Agent for direct trades (micro actions), Data Agent for macro pulls. A2A: Strategy signals to execution messages; Reflection: Basic logs for reviews. | Yes: Native IBKR TWS integration. | Broker bridge essential for trading; organizes micro-level A2A with backups for seamless funding prototypes. |
| yfinance (9) | Data Agent | Strategy Agent, Reflection Agent | Real-time data feeds: Data Agent for macro ingestion (market quotes). A2A: Cleaned DataFrames to other agents; Reflection: Historical data for backtests. | Partial: Complements IBKR with external validation. | Data foundation for broad view; supports daily macro-micro flows with traceable A2A, enhancing reflection for edges. |
| tsfresh (10) | Data Agent, Learning Agent | Risk Agent | Feature extraction: Data Agent for macro time series processing, Learning Agent for ML features (experiential signals). A2A: Features shared for probability calcs; Reflection: Auto-features for outcome analysis. | No direct, but processes IBKR data. | Time series ML for edge discovery; backs agent organization by automating inputs, scalable for funded ML refinements. |
| exchange-calendars | Execution Agent, Reflection Agent | Data Agent | Trading schedules: Execution Agent for final time-constraint checks (e.g., market hours validation before trades), Reflection Agent for incorporating in reviews. A2A: Shares calendar data for common-sense tests; Reflection: Ensures clarity by avoiding delusional off-hours executions. | Partial: Validates sessions for IBKR submissions. | Time-focused for constraints; enhances final reflection step, providing backups for funded risk reduction through reality-based validations.

Reasoning: Mappings ensure closed-loop system (e.g., Data feeds Strategy, Reflection iterates Learning), with backups for A2A efficiency and profitability; exchange-calendars adds time robustness.
