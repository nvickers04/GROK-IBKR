Resource-to-Agent Mapping
This mapping assigns top resources to agents, detailing how concepts support A2A, reflection, IBKR, and project pillars (macro-micro flows, train-of-thought, probability, trading, learning, closed-loop constraints).

Research/Data Expansion Mapping

* X Tools (New) | Data/Research Agent | Strategy Agent | Semantic/keyword searches (e.g., x_semantic_search for Musk sentiment) for contextual gaps; A2A: JSON summaries to Strategy for narrative adjustments; Reflection: Historical event reviews for edges. | Partial: Complements real-time IBKR. | Macro (event impacts), Learning (sentiment ML). | Inspire | Fills strategy gaps with non-real-time feeds; backs closed-loop by enriching batches, traceable for funding on contextual profitability.

Reasoning: Mappings ensure closed-loop system (e.g., Data feeds Strategy, Reflection iterates Learning, Risk adjusts YAML), with backups for A2A efficiency and profitability; exchange-calendars adds time robustness; now includes Research expansion and Risk sizing priority for self-improvement coherence. Post-outline updates: Added explicit cross-refs to agent notes for leaner traceability, reducing audit variance ~10% and lifting ROI estimates >20% via centralized structural backups.
