# Integration Plan

This plan details conceptual integration of resources, agents, A2A, reflection, and IBKR—phased for scalability, with explicit A2A connections (standardized handoffs) and decision loops (if-then branches for soundness).

## Phases
1. **Planning Phase**: Populate text files (current); map resources to agents (e.g., yfinance to Data for macro feeds).
2. **Conceptual Design**: Define A2A protocols (e.g., shared JSON from Qlib-inspired pipelines); introduce Data Agent expansion for contextual feeds (e.g., X semantic searches for credible financial updates like Musk/Trump sentiment from verified sources).
3. **IBKR Bridge**: Use ib_nope/nautilus_trader concepts for Execution Agent (e.g., API validation before trades); add USD/no-trade benchmark (inflation_proxy from Data Agent); integrate paper trading for loop testing (realistic API sims with conservative slippage).
4. **Reflection Loops**: Zipline/FinRL for iterative reviews in Reflection/Learning Agents; add exchange-calendars for time-constrained final checks in Execution (e.g., market hours validation with common-sense test); incorporate weekly SD batching with Risk-led YAML adjustments (prioritize max_position_size, max_hold_days via dual sims: Zipline broad, tf-quant-finance stochastic); quarterly Reflection audits for profitability targets (pure review).
5. **Testing Concepts**: Manual sims in text (e.g., describe macro-micro flow outcomes); pre-launch Risk sims (both tools for baselines, slippage conservative)—flesh ideas via text outlines (e.g., "Sim Cycle: Zipline historical sizing test on 2020 data; tf stochastic variance projection for hold days under volatility").

## A2A Connections (Standardized Handoffs)
- **Data → Strategy**: DataFrame of processed inputs (e.g., yfinance + X sentiment summaries); connection: Daily macro feed for proposal generation.
- **Strategy → Risk**: JSON proposal (train-of-thought logic + pop estimate); connection: Macro-micro transition for probability eval.
- **Risk → Execution**: Adjusted probs/limits (JSON diffs from YAMLs); connection: Risk assessment for pre-execution validation.
- **Execution → Reflection**: JSON logs (trade/no-trade outcomes with inflation metrics); connection: Micro results for post-review.
- **Reflection → Learning**: Metric insights (DataFrames for variances); connection: Experiential feedback for ML refinements.
- **Learning → Data**: Batch directives (DataFrames for refinements); connection: Processed sim knowledge distribution (per-week log reference).
- **Cross-Loop (All Agents)**: YAML queries (JSON for profitability-targets/risk-constraints); connection: Quarterly audits via Reflection poll.

## Decision Loops (If-Then Branches for Soundness)
- **Weekly Batch Trigger Loop**: If SD >1.0 in Learning batch (from Risk/Execution logs), then trigger Data refinements (A2A directive); else, maintain status quo—ties to profitability (e.g., "Variance > threshold: Adjust for 22% ROI estimate vs 20% goal").
- **Pre-Execution Reflection Loop**: If time/sanity check fails (exchange-calendars + common-sense), then loop back to Strategy/Risk for iteration; else, proceed to trade/no-trade—ties to profitability (e.g., "No-trade if alpha < floor: Preserves 10% monthly baseline").
- **Quarterly Audit Loop**: If Q1 cumulative <30% vs target (Reflection poll), then A2A review for estimates >20% (no penalties, pure review); else, log success—ties to profitability (e.g., "Audit: 18% achieved; vote on 25% Q2 upside").
- **Sim Processing Loop**: If sim results processed (per-week log), then distribute knowledge via A2A DataFrames to agents; else, retry offline run—ties to profitability (e.g., "Sim lift +1.2% ROI: Feeds batch for target alignment").

## A2A and Reflection Management
- A2A: Use event-driven (backtrader) or data-sharing (pandas from yfinance) formats; extend to Data Agent for X feeds (JSON summaries).
- Reflection: Post-trade metrics (pyfolio) feed Learning for probability refinements; pre-execution final step ensures time/clarity; Risk auto-adjusts all YAML metrics post-reflection (sims pre-launch); Execution logs performance for all outcomes (trades/holds) for risk reduction; loose expense tracking in dashboard for quarterly reviews (optional trigger).

Reasoning: Phased approach backs funding with milestones; ensures robust organization for profitable, experiential system, with time constraints reducing invalid trades; now expanded with A2A connections (bidirectional handoffs) and decision loops (if-then for soundness), tying to aspirational ROI (e.g., "Loops preserve 18% Q1 estimate vs 20% goal") for coherence and technical journey reduction.
