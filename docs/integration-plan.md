# Integration Plan

This plan details conceptual integration of resources, agents, A2A, reflection, and IBKRâ€”phased for scalability.

## Phases
1. **Planning Phase**: Populate text files (current); map resources to agents.
2. **Conceptual Design**: Define A2A protocols (e.g., shared JSON from Qlib-inspired pipelines); introduce Research Agent or Data expansion for contextual feeds (e.g., X semantic searches for sentiment).
3. **IBKR Bridge**: Use ib_nope/nautilus_trader concepts for Execution Agent (e.g., API validation before trades); add USD/no-trade benchmark (inflation_proxy from Data Agent).
4. **Reflection Loops**: Zipline/FinRL for iterative reviews in Reflection/Learning Agents; add exchange-calendars for time-constrained final checks in Execution (e.g., market hours validation with common-sense test); incorporate weekly SD batching with Risk-led YAML adjustments (prioritize max_position_size, max_hold_days).
5. **Testing Concepts**: Manual sims in text (e.g., describe macro-micro flow outcomes); pre-launch Risk sims (both Zipline broad backtests and tf-quant-finance stochastic).

## A2A and Reflection Management
- A2A: Use event-driven (backtrader) or data-sharing (pandas from yfinance) formats; extend to Research/Data for X feeds (JSON summaries).
- Reflection: Post-trade metrics (pyfolio) feed Learning for probability refinements; pre-execution final step ensures time/clarity; Risk auto-adjusts all YAML metrics post-reflection (sims pre-launch).

Reasoning: Phased approach backs funding with milestones; ensures robust organization for profitable, experiential system, with time constraints reducing invalid trades; now closed-loop via Risk sizing priority and Research expansion for contextual gaps.
