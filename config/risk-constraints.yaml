Risk Constraints Configuration
Dynamically managed by Risk Agent post-reflection; loaded by all agents via A2A for closed-loop enforcement.
Structural Reasoning: Enables self-improving limits (e.g., adjusted via weekly SD batches); traceable for funding audits on risk mitigation without manual tweaks. Simulations (pre-launch Zipline-inspired) set baselines; post-launch experiential (no slippage sims—conservative tolerances only).
Position and Exposure Limits
max_position_size: 0.05 # Max % of portfolio per trade; auto-tightens on variance >1 SD (Risk Agent sims) max_leverage: 2.0 # Overall leverage cap; reflects stochastic sims from tf-quant-finance (pre-launch only) max_daily_trades: 10 # Batch-enforced to avoid over-execution noise; adjustable via reflection variances
Drawdown and POP Safeguards
max_drawdown: 0.05 # 5% portfolio drawdown threshold; triggers reflection loop (Risk Agent auto-adjusts post-sim) pop_floor: 0.60 # Minimum theoretical POP for approval; adjusted via pyfolio metrics and USD benchmark variance_sd_threshold: 1.0 # SD cutoff for weekly batch triggers; recalibrated experientially (Risk Agent core)
Time and Sanity Constraints
max_hold_days: 30 # Trade duration cap; ties to exchange-calendars for sessions (Execution no-trade ref) slippage_tolerance: 0.02 # % slippage allowance; conservative (no accurate sims—live IBKR only); Risk Agent tightens on variances
USD Benchmark for No-Trade Decisions
usd_hold_alpha_floor: 0.0 # Minimum alpha vs USD (inflation-adjusted) to execute; Execution references for "no trade" as valid option inflation_proxy: 0.025 # Annual % for USD opportunity cost (e.g., vs gold/crypto/FX); Risk Agent updates quarterly via sims
Changelog Reference
last_update: "2025-10-23" # Timestamped by Risk Agent; high-level summary in core/learning-data-changelog.txt adjustment_rationale: "Initial baselines; next update post-Week 42 batch if SD >1.0 (Risk Agent sims pre-launch; experiential post)"
Reasoning: YAML format for readability in VS Code; keys as A2A-queryable (e.g., JSON exports); backs closed-loop profitability by enabling Risk-led auto-adjustments of all metrics, with pre-launch sims (slippage-limited) and USD ties for no-trade discipline, experiential for ~10-20% risk reduction in audits.
