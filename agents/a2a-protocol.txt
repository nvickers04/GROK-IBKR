A2A Protocol

Defines agent-to-agent communication standards.
- Formats: JSON for events (backtrader-inspired), DataFrames for data (pandas from Qlib/yfinance).
- Flows: Data → Strategy → Risk → Execution (with final reflection pull from Reflection for time/common-sense checks via exchange-calendars) → Reflection → Learning (loop back).
- Reflection Integration: Include metrics (pyfolio) and time validations in messages for reviews.

Reasoning: Standardizes for robust scalability; backs funding with efficient, auditable interactions, now including time-constrained clarity.
