Risk Agent Notes

Role: Probability assessments and risk management.
Inspirations: pyfolio (performance metrics), tf-quant-finance (stochastic models), tsfresh (risk features).
A2A: Inputs strategies, outputs adjusted probs to Execution/Reflection.
Reflection Tie: Supplies metrics for reviews.
IBKR Fit: Uses portfolio data for real-time calcs.

Reasoning: Ensures risk-averse profitability; quantifiable backups for funding on probability-driven decisions.

Stochastic Outputs for Batching
- Generate daily JSON logs of stochastic models (e.g., Brownian motion or Monte Carlo sims for POP distributions via tf-quant-finance).
- Include variance proxies (e.g., Sharpe ratios with randomness); feed to Learning Agent for weekly aggregation/SD thresholding.
- A2A Formats: JSON for lightweight daily events; incorporate weekly batch references for contextual risk evals (e.g., adjust probs based on prior variances).
- Consultation Role: Respond to Learning Agent traces on inconsistencies (e.g., validate theoretical POP against stochastic baselines).

Dynamic Management of Risk Constraints
- Load config/risk-constraints.yaml at assessment start (e.g., YAML keys for max_position_size, variance_sd_threshold).
- Post-reflection (e.g., after weekly batch from Learning Agent), simulate adjustments (e.g., tighten pop_floor if SD variance >1.0 using tf-quant-finance projections).
- Write updates via A2A (e.g., JSON diffs shared to agents); log high-level rationale to core/learning-data-changelog.txt (e.g., "Week 42: SD 1.2; reduced max_drawdown to 4.2%").
- Closed-Loop Enforcement: All agents reference YAML for limits (e.g., Execution queries slippage_tolerance); no manual editsâ€”experiential triggers only.

Reasoning: Shifts constraints to self-improving loop via Risk-led adjustments; backs closed-loop profitability by integrating SD batches for dynamic safeguards, providing auditable traces for funding on variance mitigation without Learning Agent overload.
