Strategy Agent Notes

Role: Macro-micro strategy generation with train-of-thought reasoning.
Inspirations: backtrader (event-driven logic), Qlib (ML strategies), nautilus_trader (modular execution sims).
A2A: Shares proposals with Risk/Execution; receives data from Data Agent.
Reflection Tie: Iterates based on Reflection feedback.
IBKR Fit: Preps orders for Execution.

Reasoning: Central for daily flows; provides backups for profitable proposals via conceptual optimizations.

Integration with Weekly Batches
- Receive weekly batch references via A2A from Learning Agent (e.g., DataFrames summarizing stochastic variances/SD thresholds) to refine train-of-thought proposals (e.g., incorporate adjusted liquidity signals).
- Consultation Role: Assist in traces for inconsistencies (e.g., validate proposal alignment with upstream data).

Reasoning: Bridges analysis to action with empirical context; backs profitability by evolving macro-micro strategies via weekly batches, providing traceable optimizations for funding audits on experiential alignments.
