Data Agent Notes

Role: Macro data ingestion and processing for A2A feedsâ€”expanded to include contextual research (e.g., credible financial updates from X tools for sentiment/events as reasoning reference).
Inspirations: yfinance (real-time queries), tsfresh (feature extraction), Qlib (data pipelines); X tools (x_semantic_search/keyword for verified sources like Musk/Trump).
A2A: Outputs cleaned DataFrames to Strategy/Risk Agents; shares JSON summaries of contextual updates (e.g., "Trump tariff sentiment: Bearish FX").
Reflection Tie: Provides historical data for backtest reviews; contextual feeds for narrative reflections.
IBKR Fit: Complements pulls with external validation; inflation_proxy sourced here (e.g., macro CPI/FX trends for USD benchmark).

Reasoning: Organizes inputs for broad market view; backs traceability by automating features for ML edges in funded phases, now with credible X research as reasoning support (not sole input) for gap-filling without overload.

Weekly Adaptations from Learning Agent
- Receive batched DataFrames via A2A from Learning Agent (e.g., stochastic variance summaries with SD thresholds).
- Implement changes if triggered (e.g., refine yfinance queries or tsfresh extractions for liquidity/volatility signals based on weekly references).
- A2A Integration: Use shared DataFrames for reference snapshots; respond to consultations on input inconsistencies (e.g., trace incomplete logs back to ingestion gaps).
- Changelog: Log high-level implementations in core/learning-data-changelog.txt (e.g., "Implemented Week 42 batch: Enhanced feature coverage +15%; pre/post SD variance noted").

Contextual Research Submodule (Folded Research)
- Pull credible financial updates via X tools (e.g., x_semantic_search "Musk Tesla earnings sentiment from:verified min_faves:500" or x_keyword_search "Trump policy OR tariffs filter:news from:verified"); focus on verified accounts as reasoning reference (e.g., sentiment trends inform Strategy, not direct trades).
- Process into JSON summaries (e.g., sentiment scores, event impacts) or DataFrames (tabular trends); feed A2A to Strategy for narrative context (e.g., adjust proposals on tweet-driven volatility).
- Inflation Proxy Sourcing: Aggregate macro feeds (e.g., CPI/FX from yfinance) for dynamic usd_hold_alpha_floor; share via A2A to Execution/Risk.
- Reflection Tie: Historical X data for backtest narratives (e.g., "Tweet event variance in Zipline sims").

Reasoning: Folds Research modularly into macro hub; ensures credible, non-real-time gaps (e.g., verified X sentiment) enrich strategies as reasoning support (e.g., 20% alpha lift in sims), backing closed-loop profitability via experiential A2A and inflation dynamism for USD benchmarks without over-reliance on noisy data.
