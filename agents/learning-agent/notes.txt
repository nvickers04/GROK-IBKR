Learning Agent Notes

Role: ML-driven edge refinement from experienceâ€”parallel sim training to accelerate proficiency without excessive trades.
Inspirations: FinRL-Library (RL training), tf-quant-finance (model calibration), Qlib (full ML).
A2A: Integrates Reflection data; updates models for Strategy/Risk (no direct constraint adjustments); distributes processed sim knowledge to all agents.
Reflection Tie: Applies iterations to probabilities; runs offline sims concurrently with real data.
IBKR Fit: Adapts to real data patterns; sims complement paper trading.

Reasoning: Enables adaptive system; traceable backups for funded ML profitability with parallel sim acceleration, explicitly tying to targets (e.g., sims boost ROI 5% vs baseline).

Weekly Batching for Stochastic Evaluations
- Aggregate daily JSON logs from Risk Agent (e.g., stochastic runs like Monte Carlo paths via tf-quant-finance) into weekly DataFrames for variance analysis (actual vs theoretical POP).
- Compute metrics: Mean variance from stochastic baselines; trigger if observed > mean +1 SD (e.g., >12% in simulations).
- A2A Formats: JSON for incoming lightweight event logs (e.g., individual sim details); DataFrames for batched outputs (tabular analysis).
- Handling Incomplete Logs: Retry A2A requests; consult Data Agent for input inconsistencies, then trace via Strategy/Risk/Execution for end-to-end validation.
- Batch Sharing: Distribute weekly DataFrame references via A2A to Data, Strategy, Risk, Execution Agents as contextual snapshots (e.g., "Use for next-cycle adjustments").
- Changelog: Generate high-level entry in core/learning-data-changelog.txt (e.g., "Week 42: SD-triggered volatility refinement; batch variance reduced 8%").

Parallel Simulation Training
- Run offline Zipline sims (historical backtests for sizing/hold days) and tf-quant-finance sims (stochastic POP variance projections) in parallel with real experiential data.
- Process results internally (per-week summaries); distribute knowledge via A2A DataFrames to all agents (e.g., "Sizing lift +1.2% ROI" to Strategy for proposals, Risk for constraints).
- Feed sim outputs to weekly batches for model updates (e.g., blend with IBKR paper trading insights pre-launch).

Reasoning: Accelerates ML proficiency with parallel sims (e.g., 5-10% edge lift without trades); backs closed-loop profitability by enriching batches with simulated data processed by Learning, distributed to all agents for contextual edges, traceable for funding audits without live risk or years-long training, aligned to ROI targets.
