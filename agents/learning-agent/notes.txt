Role: ML-driven edge refinement from experience.
Inspirations: FinRL-Library (RL training), tf-quant-finance (model calibration), Qlib (full ML).
A2A: Integrates Reflection data; updates models for Strategy/Risk.
Reflection Tie: Applies iterations to probabilities.
IBKR Fit: Adapts to real data patterns.

Reasoning: Enables adaptive system; traceable backups for funded ML profitability.
