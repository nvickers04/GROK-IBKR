Learning Agent Notes

Role: ML-driven edge refinement from experience.
Inspirations: FinRL-Library (RL training), tf-quant-finance (model calibration), Qlib (full ML).
A2A: Integrates Reflection data; updates models for Strategy/Risk.
Reflection Tie: Applies iterations to probabilities.
IBKR Fit: Adapts to real data patterns.

Reasoning: Enables adaptive system; traceable backups for funded ML profitability.

Weekly Batching for Stochastic Evaluations
- Aggregate daily JSON logs from Risk Agent (e.g., stochastic runs like Monte Carlo paths via tf-quant-finance inspirations) into weekly DataFrames for variance analysis (actual vs theoretical POP).
- Compute metrics: Mean variance from stochastic baselines; trigger if observed > mean +1 SD (e.g., >12% in simulations).
- A2A Formats: JSON for incoming lightweight event logs (e.g., individual sim details); DataFrames for batched outputs (tabular summaries for analysis).
- Handling Incomplete Logs: Retry A2A requests; consult Data Agent for input inconsistencies, then trace via Strategy (proposal alignment), Risk (POP baselines), Execution (log completeness) for end-to-end validation.
- Batch Sharing: Distribute weekly DataFrame references via A2A to Data, Strategy, Risk, and Execution Agents as contextual snapshots (e.g., "Use for next-cycle adjustments").
- Changelog: Generate high-level entry in core/learning-data-changelog.txt (e.g., "Week 42: SD-triggered volatility refinement; batch variance reduced 8%").

Reasoning: Centralizes experiential hub with statistical rigor; backs profitability by filtering randomness in stochastic data via weekly/SD cycles, providing auditable A2A traces for funding without daily over-adjustments.
