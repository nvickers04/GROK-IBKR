v0.1.0 - Established core planning files for agents, utilities, and IBKR integration.
# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to the AI Portfolio Manager project will be documented in this file.

## [v0.2.0] - 2025-10-22
- Integrated weekly stochastic batching for Learning Agent: SD-thresholded POP evaluations with DataFrame consolidation for problem trades.
- Added A2A batch sharing as references to Data/Strategy/Risk/Execution; retry/consultation for incomplete logs.
- Dedicated core/learning-data-changelog.txt for high-level Learning-to-Data summaries (with SD metrics).
- Updated agent notes and architecture.md for batching ties.

Reasoning: Tracks structural evolution for audits; backs profitability by logging experiential refinements, e.g., variance reductions from SD triggers.

## [v0.1.0] - Initial Setup
- Established core file structure for multi-agent system, including A2A protocols and reflection management outlines.

Reasoning: Baseline for traceability; ensures broad view of macro-micro flows with IBKR linkages.
