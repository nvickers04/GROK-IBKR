Data Handling Outline

Centralized data processing inspired by yfinance (fetching), tsfresh (feature extraction), and Qlib (pipelines). Primary use in Data Agent for ingestion and sharing via A2A feeds; supports reflection via historical storage.

Reasoning: Centralizes inputs for traceability, enabling broad market views and macro-micro transitions without siloed data.

Batching and Changelog Integration
- Incorporate weekly Learning Agent directives into pipelines (e.g., tsfresh extractions refined per SD-thresholded batches from stochastic summaries).
- Maintain core/learning-data-changelog.txt as dedicated log for changes (high-level format: Date | Weekly Batch Summary | Adjustment | Impact Metric, e.g., "2025-10-29 | Variance >1 SD | Volatility filter update | +12% feature stability").
- A2A Ties: Use DataFrames for batch references; support consultations on input traces.

Reasoning: Modularizes shared utilities with weekly stability; provides centralized backups for experiential flows, ensuring funding audits trace how stochastic batching enhances data quality without over-adjustments.
